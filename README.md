# DL-Projects

A collection of Deep Learning projects implemented using Jupyter Notebook. Each project demonstrates different applications of neural networks and deep learning techniques.

## Projects

### 1. CIFAR Image Classification
- Implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Uses TensorFlow/Keras for model building and training.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

### 2. Face Mask Detection
- Detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not using deep learning.
- Uses a CNN-based model trained on a dataset of masked and unmasked faces.
- Suitable for real-time mask detection in public spaces.

### 3. MNIST Digit Classification
- Uses a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- Implements a simple yet effective CNN architecture.
- Achieves high accuracy on digit recognition tasks.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis - IMDB Movie Reviews
- Performs sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using deep learning.
- Uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and LSTMs for text classification.
- Classifies reviews as positive or negative based on sentiment.
